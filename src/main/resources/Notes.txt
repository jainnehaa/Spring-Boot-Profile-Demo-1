## when we have both application-default.properties and application.properties
* when profile is set to dev (not default), only application.properties is also referred as secondary and error thrown for those values only in application-default.properties
* when profile is set to default, applications.properties is also checked - as secondary
* when profile is not set, application-default is picked as primary and application.properties as secondary

## when only application-default.properties is present and no application.properties 
* when profile is set to dev (not default), error thrown for those values only in application-default.properties

## preference : application-dev.properties > applications.properties, when specific profile is active
## preference goes to latter(say, in example to prod), when two specified : -Dspring.profiles.active=dev,prod
## preference : Context parameter in web.xml > WebApplicationInitializer > JVM System parameter > Environment variable > Maven profile

## VM or JVM Params : -Dspring.profiles.active=dev
